- correct response (left, right): dependent Factor.
- congruency (congruent, incongruent): dependent Factor.
- task Transition (repetition, switch). dependent Factor of task:

constraints:
- counterbalancing congruency x response x task x task-Transition x response-Transition x color x motion
- no more than 7 task repetitions in a row
- no more than 7 task switches in a row
- no more than 7 response repetitions in a row
